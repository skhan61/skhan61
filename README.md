- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Sayem Khan.
- ðŸ”§ I live at the exciting crossroads of AI and software engineering, where I tinker with algorithms and code to create smarter systems that do amazing things.
- ðŸŽ“ I've spent quite some time in academia, earning Master's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. It's been a wild ride that's armed me with a toolbox full of analytical and tech skills, ready to tackle the next big challenge.
- ðŸ’­ I'm all about dreaming up and building AI-powered software. It's kind of my thing â€“ turning complex problems into streamlined, intelligent solutions that work smarter, not harder.
- ðŸ“Š The world of machine learning and finance is my playground. I love diving into data, teasing out patterns, and designing strategies that might be the next big thing in trading.
- ðŸš€ Entrepreneurship in tech is where I see the future taking us. I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects that use AI to shake things up, invent something new, and really make a difference.
- ðŸŒ± I'm always up for a good chat about tech, AI, or anything else that pushes the envelope. I'm here if you're cooking something cool or want to exchange ideas.
- ðŸ“« You can find me at sayem.eee.kuet@gmail.com. Let's make something extraordinary together!
